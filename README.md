### Features Left to Implement

- Making the Buy Now section more compact.
- Make images a little smaller.
- Correct the Buy Now button position.
- Hide navbar on scroll down and show on scroll up.

## Testing 

I began by using Love Running as a reference since I lack expertise in design and lean more towards backend development, where my interests lie. I ensured responsiveness across all screen sizes, from mobile to desktop, was a priority achieved through media queries and flexible styling. The cover text banner smoothly adjusts with tab resizing. Initially, the "Buy now" button appeared satisfactory, but a last-minute fix was necessary due to an error uncovered during code validation (I nested a button element within an <a> element oops!). While aiming to minimize the use of images for performance reasons, I incorporated hover effects for visual appeal, maintaining a consistent blue theme throughout.

### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](/readme_assets/autoghost_validator_html.png)
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](/readme_assets/autoghost_validator_css.png)

### Unfixed Bugs

- Buy now button is inside the image.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub) 

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
